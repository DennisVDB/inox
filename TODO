TODO: 
Benchmarks to think about

1. Lazy constraint solving 	
	We can get demand driven pointer-analysis. Can we prove its running time ?

2. Packrat parsers uses memoization
	Can we prove its running time ?

3. ConcTrees full version ?

4. Binomial heaps ?

5. Futures: How about redex algorithms or map-reduce algorithms ?

Things to implement:

a) A way to check monotonicity of preconditions
b) Use monotonicity while checking proofs
c) Extensions for futures 
d) Extensions for memoization
e) Extending Orb for type parameters

Integration

Try to fix bugs in CVC4 proof and also try to integerate it with the system
Try to integrate the tool with Orb
