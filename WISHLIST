Add here what you would love FunCheck to be able to do
------------------------------------------------------

PS: generate VCs for preconditions
PS: generate VCs for pattern-matching
PS: support multiple top-level objects
PS: use 'private' accessor to indicate what's part of the interface
PS: support tuples (including natively in Z3)

Wishes granted so far
---------------------

PS: create a wishlist
PS: rewrite pattern-matching translator to use if-then-else
VK: add IsValid class to allow for writing just "holds" in place of ensuring(_ == true)
