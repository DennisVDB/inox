Synthesis
=========

Software synthesis offers an alternative way of developing trustworthy
programs. At a high level, program specifications describe **what** the
function should do, and its corresponding implementation describes **how** it
will do it. While verification ensures that both views match, synthesis
consists of translating these specifications (or expectations) to executable
programs which realises them.

As we have seen previously, relatively precise specifications of complex
operations can be written consicely. Synthesis can thus reduce development time
and allows the user to focus on high-level aspects.
