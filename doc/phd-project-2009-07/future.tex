\section{Future Work}
\paragraph{Implementation}
The natural next step is to finish our implementation. This involves several
challenges, some purely technical, such as dealing with the internal structure
of {\tt scalac}, other more theoretical, such as how to automate fold/unfold
reasoning techniques.

\paragraph{Extension of {\purescala}}
We would like to support \emph{extractors} \cite{burak06mop}in {\purescala}. Extractors are user
defined functions to perform pattern-matching on recursive data types using a
different construction mechanism that the standard one consisting on matching
on the constructor arguments. To use a different terminology, they provide a
different \emph{view} on the same data. Supporting extractors and universally
quantified specifications over them would allow us to superseed some of our
previous work \cite{dotta08pm}.

In the longer term, we would like to keep {\purescala} as our specification
language, but start extending the verified language. Some of the features we
want to add include standard classes with mutable fields and comparison by
reference.
