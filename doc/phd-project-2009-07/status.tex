\section{Implementation Status}
Our implementation is still at an early stage. We have defined a representation
for abstract syntax trees of {\purescala} programs, and have started working on
a compiler plugin for {\tt scalac} which generates the proper AST from actual
Scala trees, and rejects Scala programs which are not {\purescala}. No
procedure for automated reasoning is yet implemented.
