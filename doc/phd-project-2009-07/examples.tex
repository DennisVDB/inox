\subsection{An Example}
Figure~\ref{fig:listset} shows an example program; a set data-structure
implemented using a linked list, along with some specifications about the
implemented functions.

\begin{figure}

\caption{A set implemented as a list in \purescala, along with universally quantified specifications.}

\end{figure}

One can note that in our example, the function \K{content} really plays
the role of an abstraction function over the implementation. This
(executable) function is then used very naturally in other contracts
specifying for instance that \K{insert} is an operation compatible with
the congruence relation defined by \K{content($a$) = content($b$)}. Such
specifications would be either very unnaturally expressed using only pre-
and post- conditions, or not expressible at all.
