\section{A Purely Functional Subset of Scala}
This section describes \purescala, the specification language of our
verification system, as well as the programming language of its first version.

\subsection{Features}
- data types

- ``all in an object''

- ignoring main method

\subsection{Specifications}
- universally quantified specs

Signature of the method used in $\forall-$assertions:

\lstinputlisting{code/forall-method.scala.cute}

For intance, we display the following universally quantified specification:

\lstinputlisting{code/spec-long.scala.cute}

\ldots as:

\lstinputlisting{code/spec-short.scala.cute}
